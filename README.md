# -Investigating-Emphysema-Severity-in-COPD-A-Regression-Approach-
# COPD Regression Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a regression analysis of the COPD dataset to investigate the variables associated with the percentage of emphysema within the lungs.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a subsample of data from the COPDGene study. The complete data and data key describing the meaning of each variable are available in separate tabs in the Excel file provided.

## Methods Used

- Univariable regression analysis
- Multivariable regression analysis
- Variable selection techniques
- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
- Missing data Handling

## Results

We conducted both univariable and multivariable regression analyses to control for other effects and identify variables significantly associated with the percentage of emphysema in COPD patients' lungs.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `code/`: Includes the Python code used for the regression analysis.
- `documentation/`: Contains any relevant documentation or reports.

## How to Use

To reproduce the analysis, you can use the code provided in the `code/` directory. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
